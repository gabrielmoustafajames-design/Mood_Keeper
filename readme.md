Mood Tracker 🧠



I made a Mood Keeper using Python that you can use in a terminal. This Mood Keeper lets you write down how you feel every day. Then you can look at statistics to see how you feel on days of the week.



🚀 Features



Log your mood for the current day



The program stores information in a text file on your computer. This means that the data is saved locally in this text file.



View happiness stats by weekday



See overall happiness percentage



🛠 This is how it works. The system is really simple to understand. It Works by following a few steps. The main thing to know is that It Works in a way. So basically It Works like this:



\* It Works when you do something



\* Then It Works some more



It Works every time you use it. The best part is that It Works for everyone.



The program saves entries in this format:



Monday/10/02/26: Happy



When checking stats, it:



Splits each line



Extracts weekday and mood



Counts totals and happy days



It shows the results
